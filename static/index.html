        1.Akinator is a video game developed by French company Elokence. During gameplay, it attempts to determine what fictional or real-life character, object, or animal the player is thinking of by asking a series of questions (similar to the game Twenty Questions). It uses an artificial intelligence program that learns the best questions to ask through its experience with players.<br>
        2.Before beginning the questionnaire, the players must think of a character, object, or animal.[1] Akinator initiates a series of questions, with "Yes", "No", "Probably", "Probably not" and "Don't know" as possible answers, to narrow down the potential item.[2][3] If the answer is narrowed down to a single likely option before 25 questions are asked, the program will automatically ask whether the item it chose is correct. If it is guessed wrong a few times in a row, the game will prompt the user to input the item's name to expand its database of choices.<br>
